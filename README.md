# Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon

This is an attempt to import the IMDB exports ([https://www.imdb.com/interfaces/](https://www.imdb.com/interfaces/)) into the [Neo4J](https://neo4j.com/)Graph DB.

Once the import is completed, the `shortestPath` function should show the Bacon number for any given actor/actress or movie.

## To Do

- Get DB to start (currently the data imports, but the DB errors when initialised)
- Build an API layer
- Find cost effective hosting, or create a set of static API files and serve from GitHub pages
